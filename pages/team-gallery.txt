**Julie Tugend**, PhD<br>Junior Professor, CY Cergy Paris Université


{bdg-link-secondary}`linkedin <TODO>`


Dr. Julie Tugend is junior professor in Geosciences at CY Cergy Paris Université (France). 
She obtained her PhD from the University of Strasbourg (France) in 2013. Her results have been highlighted as *Research 
Spotlight* {cite:p}`tugend2014formation` and "Research Focus" {cite:p}`tugend2015spatial`. 


As a postdoctoral research fellow at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, between the Universities of Strasbourg and Liverpool and at Sorbonne Université, she focused on the structural, magmatic and stratigraphic analysis of rifted margins coupling seismic and field observations to geophysical and geodynamic quantitative analyses. 

Based on her multidisciplinary approach, she aims to bring new perspectives on the spatial and temporal variability of continental breakup processes and on the role of passive margin architecture on the dynamics of convergence.

**Geoffroy Mohn**, PhD - *Principal Investigator*<br>Associate Professor, CY Cergy Paris Université


{bdg-link-secondary}`linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffroy-mohn-91410224/>`


Dr. Geoffroy Mohn is associate professor in Tectonics at CY Cergy-Paris Université (France) since 2012. He obtained his PhD from the University of Strasbourg in 2010, followed by a postdoctoral scholarship between the University of Strasbourg (France), University of Lausanne (Switzerland) and EXXONMOBIL-Upstream Research Company-Houston. His research focuses on the mechanisms of continental lithospheric thinning and breakup and the associated sedimentary record using offshore and onshore case studies. He also investigates the interaction between hyperextension and evaporite/salt deposition and the effect of mobile salt on the stratigraphic architecture of rift basins.

Dr Geoffroy Mohn is actively involved in IODP and is the referent for his laboratory. He participated and sailed on the IODP expeditions 368 and 396, which occurred in 2017 and 2021 in the South China Sea and Mid-Norvegian rifted margins respectively.
